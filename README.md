# Diabetes-Prediction-with-PyCaret
machine learning model for prediction of diabetes

**Here is a short FAQ about this repository**

**1) What is this repository about?**

This repository contains a Machine Learning model for diabetes prediction.

It includes the jupyter notebook (.ipynb), .csv file and a readme.

**2) Which dataset has been used and where to find it?**

The actual dataset used here is from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

**3) What does the dataset contain?**

This dataset contains 768 entries and 9 attributes related to diabetes.

**4) Which type of ML model is it and what has been the approach to build it?**

This is a classification type of ML model. Initially an EDA has been done to understand the features and later PyCaret quickly selecting best-performing algorithms. 

**5) Which tool and which libraries have been used in this project?**

This project has been entirely completed in Jupyter IDE with Python 3.8.5.

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and PyCaret.

Details of the EDA and model setup are discussed in my article https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/diabetes-prediction-with-pycaret/ published on AnalyticsVidhya.
